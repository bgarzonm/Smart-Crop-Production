# Smart Crop Production

Our goal is to optimize rice production in Tolima, Colombia by leveraging machine learning algorithms and climate forecasting. With this project, we aim to create a sustainable, efficient, and high-yield agriculture system.

This repository will host our codebase for the machine learning algorithms that will be developed to analyze different factors such as soil conditions, weather patterns, and historical data to make predictions about the ideal time to plant, water, and harvest rice crops.

In addition to the machine learning algorithms, we will also develop tools for climate forecasting that will enable us to predict weather patterns, precipitation, and temperature changes that could impact rice production.
